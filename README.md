# Memory Game 🚀

## Game overview guide 📓

Red, blue, and green squares appear randomly on a **4 x 4** grid, one after another, once the game
starts. Each square is visible for one second before disappearing.

You must **correctly enter how many red, blue, and green squares appeared.**
The game begins with three squares appearing randomly on the
board.

Each level includes **three input fields** for
entering the number of squares that appeared for each color.

You start the game with **10 lives.** For each
incorrect answer, you lose one life. When you reach zero lives,
the game ends.

If you answer correctly, you can progress to the next level. The
game becomes more difficult by increasing the number of squares
that appear on the board by one with each level.

Good luck!
