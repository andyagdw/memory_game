# Memory Game 🚀

## Game overview guide 📓

Red, Blue, Green squares appear randomly on a **4 x 4 grid** one after the other when a game has started (occurs after one second the _Start Game_ button is clicked).
Each square is visible for one second and then disappears.

You need to **correctly enter in how many red, blue, and green squares appeared on the board**.

Each level has **three input fields** for entering the number of squares that appeared for each colour.

**You have 12 lives**. This means that when you get an answer wrong, you can try again. However, though the number of squares that appear on the board will be the same, the pattern will be different!

For each incorrect answer, you lose one life. When you reach zero lives, the game ends.

If you get the answer right, you progress to the next stage. You can do this by clicking the _Next_ button. The game gets harder
by increasing the number of squares that appear on the board by one for every level.

The game starts with three squares that appear randomly on the board.
