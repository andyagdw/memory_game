# Memory Game 🚀

## Game overview guide 📓

Red, Blue, Green squares appear randomly on a **4 x 4 grid** one after the other when a game has started (occurs after two seconds the _Start_ button is clicked).
They are visible for around one second and then disappears.

The user needs to **correctly enter in how many red, blue, and green squares appeared**.

There will be three input fields:

    - Input field one - how many red squares appeared
    - Input field two - how many blue squares appeared
    - Input field three - how many green squares appeared

If the user gets the answer wrong, the game ends. "Game over" message appears on the screen. The user can then choose to play again
by clicking the _Play Again_ button.

If the user gets the answer right, the user progresses to the next stage. They do this by clicking the _Next_ button. The game gets harder
by increasing the number of sqaures that appear on the board by one for every level.

The game starts with three squares that appear randomly on the board.

- User has three lives. For every question they get wrong, the number of lives decreases by one. If the user has zero lives, the game ends.
- Related to the first one, for every question the user gets wrong, they can try again. The pattern will be different but the number of squares that appear remain the same.
